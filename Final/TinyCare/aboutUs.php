            <h3>Recruitment</h3>
            At Tiny Care one of our highest priorities is ensuring that our teachers and staff are exceptional. We
            interview each teacher as if they will be teaching our own children and, in some cases, they will be. We
            go
            beyond the basic state requirements and look for individuals who embody and support our mission. We look
            for
            staff that are loving, caring, dynamic and have a commitment to our children.

            We welcome opportunities to build understanding and knowledge of people around the globe, and in our own
            communities. In addition to celebrating traditional American holidays, like Christmas and New Year's Day, we
            also recognize heritage months throughout the year to build stronger connections that present opportunities
            to practice empathy, compassion and inclusion. </p>
