                Working the 8-hour shift, trying to do dinner, then help my son with homework, and I still have a
                2-year-old on top of it ... It's been really challenging. Having the structure of Tiny Care helps my
                kids a lot..

                We would not be able to do what we do if it wasn't for having such a strong daycare setting. Thanks to
                Tiny
                Care, I think here we felt really, really safe. We have felt really good with the decision. It’s a good
                experience. I think it helps the overall stress, at least for us. Kids are resilient, and it's sort of
                shocking to me sometimes how lucky we are as parents— we have such good kids."</p>
